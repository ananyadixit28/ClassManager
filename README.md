# ClassManager
An app which lets you create a Class/Course you are teaching and handle day to day activities related to it.
You can register as a teacher or a student and continue handling your courses with ease.
Teachers can create classes using the "create class" feature and share the key to their students and ask them to join the class.
Students can join the class through a unique "key" which is generated for each of your courses.
Teachers can take attendance , allot marks and even chat with the students through a group chat created for different courses.
Group members also have the facility of sending images in the chats section.
